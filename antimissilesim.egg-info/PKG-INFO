# Anti-Missile Missile Simulation

## About
In path planning, collision avoidance must be carefully balanced against the objective of reaching a designated goal. While many methods exist for path planning in both static and dynamic environments, these solutions become more difficult when the environment is assumed to be adversarial. In this project, we investigate decision-making methods for adversarial avoidance path planning in the context of an anti-missile avoidance game, where a missile aims to reach its target despite an active defense system seeking interception.

To address this question, we map the problem onto a missile/anti-missile game scenario in a controlled simulation environment. A missile navigates toward a specified target, and the environment contains an adversarial threat that can intercept it. We examine three decision-making approaches under uncertainty to avoid interception:

- **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS):** A simulation-based search technique that iteratively builds a decision tree, balancing exploration and exploitation.
- **Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP):** A probabilistic framework designed to handle situations where the true state of the environment is not fully known.
- **Kalman Filtering-based Path Planning:** An approach using state estimation to track positions and guide the missile through noisy or incomplete information. By varying factors such as the start and target location, we can evaluate how each method performs in terms of collision avoidance and goal attainment.

## Installation

To install the package and its dependencies, follow these steps:

### Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/matte773/AntimissileSimulation.git
cd AntimissileSimulation
```

To enter into the venv enter the following:
Using `pip`, install the package in editable mode:

```sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Install the Package

Using `pip`, install the package in editable mode:

```sh
pip install -e .
```

## Running the Code

Once installed, you can run the anti-missile simulation using the `cli.py` script with different modes and options.

### Basic Usage

Run the default simulation using Kalman filtering:

```sh
python -m AntimissileSimulation.cli --mode kalman
```

Run using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS):

```sh
python -m AntimissileSimulation.cli --mode mcts
```

Run using Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP):

```sh
python -m AntimissileSimulation.cli --mode pomdp
```

### Additional Flags

You can customize the simulation by providing additional command-line arguments:

- `--show_plots`: Enables plot animation (default is disabled).
  
  ```sh
  python -m AntimissileSimulation.cli --mode kalman --show_plots
  ```

- `--num_simulations <int>`: Number of simulations to run (default: 100).
  
  ```sh
  python -m AntimissileSimulation.cli --num_simulations 500
  ```

- `--max_steps <int>`: Maximum number of steps per simulation (default: 1000).
  
  ```sh
  python -m AntimissileSimulation.cli --max_steps 2000
  ```

- `--missile_position <x y z>`: Initial missile position in 3D space. If this flag is left out the inital position will be randomized (recommended).
  
  ```sh
  python -m AntimissileSimulation.cli --missile_position 0 0 100
  ```

- `--antimissile_position <x y z>`: Initial anti-missile position in 3D space. If this flag is left out the inital position will be randomized (recommended).
  
  ```sh
  python -m AntimissileSimulation.cli --antimissile_position 10 10 200
  ```

- `--goal_position <x y z>`: Goal position for the missile. If this flag is left out the inital position will be randomized (recommended).
  
  ```sh
  python -m AntimissileSimulation.cli --goal_position 50 50 0
  ```

- `--missile_velocity <float>`: Set missile velocity (default: 100).
  
  ```sh
  python -m AntimissileSimulation.cli --missile_velocity 150
  ```

- `--antimissile_velocity <float>`: Set anti-missile velocity (default: 105).
  
  ```sh
  python -m AntimissileSimulation.cli --antimissile_velocity 120
  ```

- `--weighting_factor <float>`: Adjusts evade weighting factor (default varies by mode: Kalman=0.5, MCTS=0.3, POMDP=0.8).
  
  ```sh
  python -m AntimissileSimulation.cli --weighting_factor 0.6
  ```

## Testing

The package includes a test suite to verify functionality. Run the tests using:

```sh
  python -m AntimissileSimulation.cli --weighting_factor 0.6
  ```
