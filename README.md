# Anti-Missile Missile Simulation

## About 
In path planning, collision avoidance must be carefully balanced against the objective of reaching a designated goal. While many methods exist for path planning in both static and dynamic environments, these solutions become more difficult when the environment is assumed to be adversarial. In this paper, we investigate decision making methods for adversarial avoidance path planning in the context of an anti-missile avoidance game, where a missile aims to reach its
target despite an active defense system seeking interception.

This project orginally started as a simulation world for an anti-missile to missile simulation so that these dynamic agents could be vessels to test path planning algorithms under uncertainty. This has further expanded into a project for the Winter 2025 Coding for Research class at OSU project. I wanted to use this follow on project as a method to tweak and test varibles in our missile, anti-missile, and path planning algorithms. 

The follow on project orginally started as: 

### deROSed_Quori_Study
This is an attempt at running the Quori Q&amp;A Study with the change of running standalone on python3. This is a project for ENGR 570, Winter 2025.

This project was abandoned because the Quori Q&A interaction depended too heavily on ROS Service timings for the interaction to usefully be ported over to standalone python code.
